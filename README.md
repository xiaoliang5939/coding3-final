I used color changes to show another visual effect of hieroglyphics.

At first, I was collecting a lot of ancient Chinese characters for another assignment, and I came across various hieroglyphs from different civilizations around the world, which piqued my interest. I gathered a substantial collection of hieroglyphs from diverse cultures and incorporated them into the dataset for my project.

The text we observe appears as monochromatic static. I aim to enhance its visual appeal by infusing vibrant colors and introducing dynamic movement. Moreover, I intend to convey the shared characteristics of hieroglyphs across various regions. Kindly assist me in reviewing and rectifying any grammatical or vocabulary errors in this paragraph.

Here are some of the data sets I collected:https://github.com/xiaoliang5939/coding3-final/blob/main/JPEG.zip

In this project, I chose to use the model from week5 for import and training, and changed the value of the cmap.

For this project, I trained for the first time with a data set I had collected.

While working on this code, I encountered several challenges. For instance, I faced issues with incorrect image formats that couldn't be read or inconsistent sizes that hindered proper recognition. Throughout the process, I sought assistance from ChatGPT to overcome these obstacles. After numerous attempts, I eventually managed to resolve the problem successfully.

In the process of testing, I encountered a lot of problems, such as the final gif changes too small. I changed a lot of values for this purpose, but nothing worked well. In fact, there is still this small problem.

However, the effect now is that you can see the text style at the bottom, and I also like the color.

Since the dynamic effect of the first job was unreasonable, I tried to replace other data sets to make a dynamic graph. This time I chose this dataset:https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar100/


This is a dataset of 50,000 32x32 color training images and 10,000 test images, labeled over 100 fine-grained classes that are grouped into 20 coarse-grained classes. See more info at the CIFAR homepage.

In this project, I used another color to make the color look more impactful.
